# Here's the index.yaml file you were looking for

Honestly, at this point, I'm just having fun with mkdocs+material. But maybe _someone_ will appreciate this. The code below is pulled directly from index.yaml, so it's the same thing that helm sees. 

``` title="index.yaml" linenums="1"
--8<-- "index.yaml"
```

You can also view the file directly [here](./index.yaml)
