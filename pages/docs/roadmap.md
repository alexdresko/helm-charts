## What lies ahead?

I don't know. This is just a weekend project. 

- [ ] Record a demo to show how to open the repo in a VS Code Dev Container, and showcase some of the things you can do with that. 
- [ ] Convert this all into a thing that other people can use to surface their own charts. There's obviously some overlap between what I've done and [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs). 
- [ ] I like the "auto-detection of field descriptions from comments" feature of [helm-docs](https://github.com/norwoodj/helm-docs)
