## What lies ahead?

I don't know. This is just a weekend project. 

- [x] Initial site launch and first helm chart (homer)
- [x] Rebuild the Dev Container and make sure everything still works. I haven't done this in a while.

- [ ] Figure out why I have duplicates in index.yaml
- [ ] Use a GH action and `mkdocs gh-pages`? I didn't know about this when I started, and it seems to be the way to go. 
- [ ] Figure out how to get VSC to let me paste images into .md files. I think I'm having trouble right now because I'm using a Dev Container. 
- [ ] Display more package information in the listing
- [ ] Figure out how to limit the listing to only show a few versions by default, and allow expanding all available versions. 
- [ ] Make the homer helm chart actually do something. At this point, all I've done is `helm create homer` because I've been having too much fun with mkdocs and material. 
- [ ] Convert this all into a thing that other people can use to surface their own charts
- [ ] Clean up the index.yaml file from all the experiments I've been doing
- [ ] Publish the charts to https://artifacthub.io/
